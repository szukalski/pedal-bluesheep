The only change has been to swap the A100K Dual pot for 2x A100K pots, splitting the boost and gain to separate controls. Apart from the practicality of avoiding dual pots in the supply chain, the separate pots give a nicer flexibility to tailor sounds for different use cases. You may disagree, then build it with a dual pot!

Thanks and enjoy as much as I did.
